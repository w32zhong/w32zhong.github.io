I am currently a Ph.D. student in the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, advised by Prof. [Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/index.html).

I started my Ph.D. study at Rochester Institute of Technology in 2017 Fall, advised by Prof. [Richard Zanibbi](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~rlaz/), but later paused and transferred to the current program in April 2021 due to the COVID-19 global pandemic.

Before that, I have received my Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering (advised by Prof. [Fang Hui](https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~hfang/)) at the University of Delaware, and my B.S. degree from Jiliang University of China, in 2015 and 2013, respectively.

In my research, I have been working on creating a math-aware search engine.
I have won two [best paper awards](/publications/) during my graduate study.
Currently, I am actively looking for a research internship.

I have a broad knowledge in computer science in general, my primary focus is currently in information retrieval, machine learning, and WEB technologies.

### Work Experience
* Apr 2021 ~ Now: Research Assistant and Teaching Assistant at University of Waterloo (Kitchener, ON, Canada)
* Apr 2020 ~ Sep 2020: Algorithm researcher at [DMAI](https://www.dm-ai.com/introduction/) (Guangzhou, China)
* Aug 2017 ~ Jul 2019: Research Assistant at Rochester Institute of Technology (Rochester, NY, USA)
* Sep 2016 ~ Aug 2017: Software Developer at [Huawei Technologies](https://www.huawei.com/en) (Shenzhen, China)
* Jun 2015 ~ Aug 2015: System developer internship at [SevOne Inc.](https://www.sevone.com/) (Wilmington DE, USA)

### Selected Projects
* [Approach Zero](https://approach0.xyz/docs/): A Math-aware search engine combining math expression and regular keywords search.
	* Ranked #1 by highest votes in year [2020](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/31296/community-promotion-ads-2020/31299#31299) and [2021](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/33720/community-ads-for-2021) of the Math Stack Exchange Community Promotion Ads.
	* Obtained the best effectiveness in the [formula retrieval task](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2936/paper-01.pdf) of [ARQMath 2021](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~dprl/ARQMath/).
    * Obtained the state-of-the-art effectiveness in all three [CLEF-2022 ARQMath tasks](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3180/paper-01.pdf).
    * I have proudly made this project demo online (using Docker swarm) and have successfully kept the site up since 2016 (served more than a million queries).
* [TinyNN](https://github.com/borgwang/tinynn) and [MNN](https://github.com/w32zhong/mnn): Deep learning projects for my study purpose. I have contributed: Denoising autoencoder (DAE), Restricted Boltzmann Machine with CD-k training, and activation maximization (AM) visualization. I have also documented manual derivations for the gradients/Jacobian matrix of typical layers.
* [FlappyBird in VHDL](https://github.com/t-k-/vhdl_flappybird): An interesting course project I made in an embedded system course using VHDL (see [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jn5G29TR8y4))
* [8-bit TTL‑CPU](https://github.com/w32zhong/my-ttl-cpu): Homebrew 8-bit TTL CPU, it successfully runs a *for loop* to calculate *1 + 2 + ... + 19* in Multisim software simulation.
