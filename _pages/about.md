I am currently a Ph.D. student in the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, advised by [Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/index.html).

I started my Ph.D. study at Rochester Institute of Technology in 2017 Fall, advised by [Richard Zanibbi](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~rlaz/), but later paused and transferred to the current program in April 2021 due to the COVID-19 global pandemic.

Before that, I received my Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering (advised by Professor [Fang Hui](https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~hfang/)) at the University of Delaware, and my B.S. degree from Jiliang University of China, in 2015 and 2013, respectively.

Please find a list of my publications [here](/publications/).
