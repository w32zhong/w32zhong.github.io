I obtained my Ph.D. degree of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo in September 2023, advised by Prof. [Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/index.html).

Started my Ph.D. study at the Rochester Institute of Technology in 2017 Fall, I initially was advised by Prof. [Richard Zanibbi](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~rlaz/), but later paused and transferred to the current program in April 2021 due to the COVID-19 global pandemic.

Before that, I have received my Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering (advised by Prof. [Fang Hui](https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~hfang/)) at the University of Delaware and my B.S. degree from Jiliang University of China in 2015 and 2013, respectively.

In my research, I have been working on creating a math-aware search engine. I have won [two best paper awards](/publications/) during my graduate study.

With a broad knowledge in computer science in general, my primary focus is currently in information retrieval, deep learning, and systems.

### Interesting Projects
* [Approach Zero](https://github.com/approach0): A math-aware search engine combining math expression and regular keyword-based retrieval.
	* Ranked #1 by top user votes in years [2020](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/31296/community-promotion-ads-2020/31299#31299) and [2021](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/33720/community-ads-for-2021) in the Math Stack Exchange Community Promotion Ads.
    * The best performance in all math-aware search tasks of [CLEF-2022 ARQMath tasks](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3180/paper-01.pdf).
	* The best unsupervised formula search in the [formula retrieval task](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2936/paper-01.pdf) of [ARQMath 2021](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~dprl/ARQMath/).
    * I have proudly made this project demo [online](https://approach0.xyz) (using Docker swarm) and have successfully kept the site up [since 2016](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/24978) (served more than a million queries).
* [TinyNN](https://github.com/borgwang/tinynn) and [MNN](https://github.com/w32zhong/mnn): Deep learning projects for my study purpose. I have contributed: Denoising autoencoder (DAE), Restricted Boltzmann Machine with CD-k training, and activation maximization (AM) visualization. I have also documented manual derivations for the gradients/Jacobian matrix of typical layers.
* [FlappyBird in VHDL](https://github.com/t-k-/vhdl_flappybird): An interesting course project I made in an embedded system course using VHDL (see [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jn5G29TR8y4))
* [8-bit TTL‑CPU](https://github.com/w32zhong/my-ttl-cpu): Homebrew 8-bit TTL CPU, it successfully runs a *for loop* to calculate *1 + 2 + ... + 19* in Multisim software simulation.
